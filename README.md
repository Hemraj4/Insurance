📊 Insurance Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project

This repository contains an end-to-end Insurance Data Analysis and Machine Learning project built using Python. The project focuses on extracting insights from insurance data and developing a predictive model to estimate medical insurance charges.

🔍 Project Overview

Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key factors affecting insurance costs

Visualized relationships between variables such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and charges

Applied feature encoding and transformation to prepare data for machine learning

Built and evaluated a machine learning regression model to predict insurance charges

Interpreted results to demonstrate how data-driven models can support decisions in the insurance and healthcare domain

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📁 Dataset

insurance.csv — contains demographic and health-related information used for analysis and modeling

🎯 Key Learnings
